# Module-18-NoSQL-Challenge-Social-Network-API


# Overview
The purpose of this project is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
